        <h2>Art Of India:</h2>
    <p>Indian art is a vibrant tapestry reflecting thousands of years of cultural, spiritual, and historical evolution. It encompasses a broad array of forms, including ancient rock paintings, detailed sculptures, intricate textiles, pottery, and world-renowned painting styles. Notable traditions include Madhubani from Bihar, Warli from Maharashtra, and Gond art of Madhya Pradesh—each rooted in local folklore and nature. Sculpture and architecture, such as temple carvings and the Ajanta caves, display high craftsmanship and religious themes.

    <h2>Culture of India:</h2>
    <p> India's culture is a diverse and ancient mosaic shaped by various religions, languages, and traditions, promoting unity amid diversity. Marriage holds a central role in Indian culture as both a religious sacrament and a social institution, often seen as the union of two families. It features deeply ritualistic ceremonies, predominantly arranged marriages influenced by family and social values, and vibrant multi-day celebrations. Marriage fosters lifelong bonds, social stability, and the preservation of cultural traditions. Despite modernization and the rise of love marriages, marriage remains a foundational pillar supporting India's social cohesion and cultural heritage.</p>

    <h2>Unity in Diversity:</h2>
    <p>Unity in diversity is a defining hallmark of India, reflecting how people from varied backgrounds—religions, languages, cultures, and traditions—live together harmoniously. Despite having over 20 official languages, numerous religions, and a spectrum of distinct cultural practices, Indians collectively uphold a strong sense of national identity. This is evident in the celebration of festivals across communities, participation in each other's traditions, and mutual respect in daily life. The spirit of unity is also supported by India's constitutional policies, which guarantee equal rights and foster coexistence. This rich tapestry of diversity, bonded by unity, strengthens social cohesion and national resilience</p>
